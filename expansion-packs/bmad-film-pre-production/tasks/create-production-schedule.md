To create a comprehensive production schedule for the film. This task guides the producer agent through the process of breaking down the script, estimating timings, and creating a detailed schedule for pre-production, production, and post-production.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 1. Script Breakdown

- Break down the screenplay into individual scenes.
- For each scene, identify the following:
  - Location
  - Cast members
  - Props
  - Costumes
  - Special equipment
  - Estimated time to shoot

### 2. Create a Stripboard

- Create a "stripboard" or "one-line schedule" that organizes the scenes by location, cast, and other dependencies.
- This will help to create the most efficient shooting schedule.

### 3. Develop the Production Schedule

- Based on the stripboard, develop a detailed production schedule.
- The schedule should include dates and times for all pre-production activities, every day of shooting, and all post-production tasks.
- Collaborate with the director and other key department heads to ensure the schedule is realistic and achievable.
- Use the `production-schedule-tmpl.md` for formatting.

### 4. Create the Call Sheets

- Once the production schedule is finalized, create call sheets for each day of shooting.
- The call sheet is a daily schedule that tells the cast and crew when and where they need to be.
- Use the `call-sheet-tmpl.md` for formatting.
- Announce the completion of the production schedule: "The production schedule for {Film Title} is complete and call sheets have been distributed."
